# Image Transformations Lab - MATLAB

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB code that demonstrates image transformation operations on grayscale images. Specifically, it covers:

1. **Gray Level Slicing** (with and without background).
2. **Bit Plane Slicing**.

The transformations highlight specific gray levels in an image and allow for visualization of how different bit planes contribute to the image structure.

## Features
- **Gray Level Slicing:**
  - **With background:** Highlights pixels in a specific gray level range while retaining the original image.
  - **Without background:** Highlights the selected gray level range and sets the rest of the image to black.

- **Bit Plane Slicing:**
  - Extracts and displays each of the 8 bit planes from a grayscale image, enabling an analysis of individual bits' influence on image representation.

## Files
- `lab04_UI22EC58.m`: MATLAB script containing the image transformation operations.
- Sample image: `coins.png`.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Place the sample image (`coins.png`) in the same directory as the script.
3. Open the MATLAB script `lab04_UI22EC58.m`.
4. Run the script to view the transformations.
